Which interface did you implement using linked lists, and why?
I implmented MyText using a doubly linked list because it was 
easier for me to conceptualize going back on a linked list. 
Also n could be infinite and there was no capacity attached to 
this part so it was easier to just do a linked list and not deal 
with circular array/ amoritizing extending the array.

Which interface did you implement using arrays, and why?
I implemented MyBoundedStack using arrays because I implemented 
MyText with a linked list and the directions said that if I used a 
linked list for one I had to use an array for the other. Also the 
capacity bit of part 2 made me think that an array was better because 
it has a max capacity.

What part or aspect of this project was the most challenging?
This project was not challenging. I am a professional at data 
structures. I am personally challenged with doing homework on time.

What part or aspect of this project was the most tedious or
uninteresting?
This project was the most fun part of the past three weekends. I got 
great use out of my whiteboard that I pulled out of the dumpster. I 
look forward to the fun of the next project.

How did the difficulty and time required for this project
compare to those in your other CS/IT courses?
Nothing compares to the insane amount of time networks is using right 
now so this was a nice light activity.

Any other comments for your instructor?
